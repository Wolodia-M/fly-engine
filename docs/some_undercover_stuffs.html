    <p>
        Enemies data are stored as struct that is stored in std::vector. It has x and y of
        start and end in grid pos. Also it has a pos in that it stay at the moment. It is 
        represented as grid pos and a shift on x and y axis. Pos in a grid cell start at 0, 0
        at up left corner. Also enemy struct has its position index counter, max position
        index and direction variable. Also it has two std::vector, that save all positions,
        that represen line from start to end and that is calculated using DDA algorithm. <br />

        Engine has class for handling texture atlass. It has array of SDL_Rects, that stores
        position of all textures, but names of textures is stored in enum, that live in another
        file ;) <br />

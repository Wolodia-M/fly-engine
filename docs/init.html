        Init of engine
    </h1>
    <p>
        Firstly you need to initialize SDL2 and SDL2_Mixer. <br />
        Then you need to initialize SDL2_renderer and SDL_Window. <br />
        Then you need to call engine.getSDL2data(renderer) where renderer - SDL_Renderer
        initialied before. <br />
        Then you can initialize texture atlas with call to engine.loadTextureAtlas
        ("path/to/file"). Argument - path to texture file in png. <br />
        Also you can initialize sounds for death and level end with call to engine.
        loadSounds("death", "", "end"). Where death - path to death sound in .wav, second 
        argument is unused, end - path to level end sound in .wav. <br />
        Also you can add your custom init, specialized for your game or for your modification
        of engine. <br />

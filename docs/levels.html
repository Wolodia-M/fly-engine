    </h1>
    <p>
        Level file contais all information about one level of game. <br />
        First line of file - rows of level grid and second - columns. <br />
        Next two lines are x and y for player start (counting start from left up corner as 
        0, 0). <br />
        Next two lines are x and y for player finish (counting start from left up corner as 
        0, 0). <br />
        Next is a level grid. In file level.template you can find all identifier for this grid. <br />
        You must have spaces betwen values and you cannot make level bigger that rows and 
        columns specified in first two lines. <br />
        Then are enemies data in format: start x, start y, end x, end y. All numbers in new 
        lines. <br />
        End last line must be "endlvl". It needed for parser. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        You can load level with call to engine.loadLevel("path to level file"). <br />
